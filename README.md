# Phiz-X


Phiz (a person's face or expression.)

Project Mentor [Akshita Gupta](https://github.com/akshitagupta15june)


Despite the availability of a variety of open source face recognition algorithms, there are no ready-made solutions which can be implemented directly. This project demonstrates all kinds of algorithms and various operations that can be implemented on a frontal face. The available algorithms process only high-resolution static shots and perform sufficiently well.


### Requirements 👇
- Python3.6+
- virtualenv (`pip install virtualenv`)

### Installation 🖥
- `virtualenvv env`
- `source venv/bin/activate` (Linux)
- `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Create an .env file, copy the content from .env.sample and add your data path. Example: `DATA_PATH = "./foto_reco/"`
